The official website for the BNCHS Robotics Team | FRC Team #5599 - The Sentinels!

Hello World

The goal is to build a beautiful modern new website, while at the same time allowing students to learn the JavaSccript ecosystem with minimal experience.

Visit the live version over at [beta.team5599.com](https://beta.team5599.com/).

**Built with JavaScript, NextJS, and Redux**

## Getting Started

To work on this project, you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12 or higher) installed. 
If you don't have an editor yet, we recommend getting started with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/Team5599/BNCHS-Sentinels-Website-v5.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd BNCHS-Sentinels-Website-v5

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the project locally
npm run dev

# This will start the nextJS application.
# A live version of the website will be available for you to preview at https://localhost:3000/

# This project supports "hot-reloading", meaning any changes you make and save in your editor
# will automatically update in the browser without needing to restart the program or reload the page

```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to ensure the application is working.

> If you have any issues with installation, please contact @MichaelRooplall
